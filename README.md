# Market Strategy
Idea is to create a tool that can help you to both test strategies and give you a trend based on the past. I use this dataset from [Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/stock-market-data).   
Once one part (or more) will be finished, i will maybe put that on a website and change the data optention in order to have something almost in direct and usefull for someone. 

## Plan
I will divide this work in three parts:
- Market Analysis
- Strategy simulator
- Strategy generator

### Market Analysis
The idea is to build an analysis of an asset, contain in the dataset. I will add dataset to compare to each other and also to validate my work.

### Strategy Simulator
Build function that we need to build a strategy and to test it.

### Strategy Generator
My idea here is to use machine learning on different time scale in order to build a strategy or at least a trend.
